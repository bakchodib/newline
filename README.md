# Firebase Studio - JLS Finance PWA

This is a NextJS starter for a microfinance PWA, now configured to use Supabase as the backend.

## Getting Started

To get your application running, you must set up your Supabase database schema first.

1.  Log in to your Supabase project dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the **SQL Editor**.
3.  Create a **New Query**.
4.  Copy the entire content of the `schema.sql` file from this project.
5.  Paste the SQL content into the query editor.
6.  Click **RUN**.

This will create all the necessary tables and security policies for the application to function correctly. After that, you can run the app and start registering users and customers.
