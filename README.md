# JLS Finance PWA

This is a NextJS starter for a microfinance PWA, now configured to use Supabase as the backend.

## Getting Started

To get your application running, you must set up your Supabase database schema first.

1.  Log in to your Supabase project dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar.
3.  Click on **"+ New query"**.
4.  Open the `schema.sql` file from this project.
5.  Copy the entire content of the file.
6.  Paste the SQL content into the query editor in Supabase.
7.  Click the green **"RUN"** button.

This will create all the necessary tables and security policies for the application to function correctly. After that, you can run the app and start registering users and customers.
